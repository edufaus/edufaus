## Hi, I'm Eduard Faus Gil!  
I'm 17 years old and attend Belen Jesuit High School. I was born in Barcelona and now live in Miami. I speak Catalan, English, and Spanish fluently. I love participating in hackathons and pitchathons, so feel free to contact me if you want to team up!

## FAQ  
- _**Why is your GitHub contribution chart so pathetic?**_  
Strong wording, but itâ€™s true. Most of the projects I work on are set to private because I don't want to clutter my GitHub profile, and more importantly, I want to avoid exposing confidential tokens. If you want to see more of my actual work, check out my Instagram (I used to post daily, but not anymoreâ€”on hiatus until I finish applying to college): [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eduard.fausgil/).

- _**An AI education app? Isn't that market already oversaturated?**_  
Yes, it is. Iâ€™ve been making education apps using AI for the past four years (to help myself study), so I figured I might as well combine them and share them with the public. I donâ€™t really care if itâ€™s oversaturated.

- _**Why does it cost money? Donâ€™t you want to help people?**_  
You're 100% rightâ€”education tools like this should be free for everyone. That being said, I really wanted to learn more about business, including handling payments, advertising, etc. Additionally, keeping the site running costs money (hosting, AI costs, etc.). **BUT I want it to be free for everyone, so just use the code STUDYFORFREE at checkout if you donâ€™t want to pay.**

- _**Where can I find the [site](https://learnique.study)?**_  
Go to [learnique.study](https://learnique.study) (It used to be [learniqueapp.netlify.app](https://learniqueapp.netlify.app), which is why the domain history is relatively new).
