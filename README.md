## FAQ
- _**Why is your github contribution chart pathetic?**_ Strong wording but it's true. Most of the projects I work on I leave on private as I don't want to clutter my github profile and more importantly don't want to have to worry about exposing confidential tokens. If you want to see more of my actual work go to my instagram (I used to post daily but not any more) (On hiatus until I finish applying to college) https://www.instagram.com/eduard.fausgil/.
- _**An AI education app, Really, isn't that like super very oversaturated?**_ Yes, yes it is. I have made education apps mostly using ai for the past 4 years (To help myself study) and thought that I might as well combine them and share them to the public so they can use it too. So I don't really care if it's oversaturated.
- _**Why does it cost money, don't you want to help people?**_ You are a 100% right educationt tools like this should be free for all. That being said I really wanted to learn more about business including taking payments, advertizing, etc. Additionally, keeping the site up costs money due to hosting, AI costs, etc.**BUT I really want it to be free for all of you so just use code STUDYFORFREE at checkout if you don't want to pay.**
- _**Where can I find the site?**_ Go to https://learnique.study (It used to be learniqueapp.netlify.app, that's why the domain history is relatively new)
